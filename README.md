For this project, I worked on training an AI pirate to find treasure in a maze using deep Q-learning. I was given some starter code, including TreasureMaze.py, which set up the maze, and GameExperience.py, which helped the AI remember past moves. The notebook also had code for showing the maze, tracking the pirate’s moves, and testing if it could reach the treasure. The code I created was to fill in the deep Q-learning training so the pirate could learn the best path over time. The main part of my work was in the qtrain function. I had to train the pirate to make smart moves. I adjusted things like exploration and exploitation, which means deciding when the pirate should try new paths versus sticking to what it already knows. I also had to tweak settings like how much memory it could store and how many times it needed to play before it got really good at finding the treasure. 

This project ties into the bigger world of computer science, especially AI and machine learning. In real life, reinforcement learning is used for things like self-driving cars, stock market predictions, and even video game AI. It’s all about teaching computers to learn from their mistakes and improve over time. This project helped me see how AI figures things out instead of just following a bunch of pre-programmed rules. One of the most important things that came out of this was that computer scientists tackle problems by breaking them down into smaller pieces. I had to consider the issue, determine how the AI should learn, and ensure it didn't become stuck. 

Of course, there are always ethical issues with AI. My pirate was simply navigating a maze in this instance, but if AI models are not properly trained, they can show prejudices in real life. AI must be fair and transparent in order to avoid making poor decisions based on inaccurate data, and it should be created to assist humans rather than to replace them. This project was a fun way to see AI in action, but it also made me think about how AI is shaping the future and the responsibility that comes with building it.
